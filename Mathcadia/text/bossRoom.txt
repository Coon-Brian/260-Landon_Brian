You have finally reached the Boss Room. You enter into a huge
Gymnasium full of chalkboards and math equations. Across the
room you see him, the Math Midterm Monster! Only it's not a
monster, it's a person that looks just like your math teacher 
you had in high school. You know... the really cranky one. 

The Math Midterm Monster approaches you with chalk in their hand
and asks...
 
" Find the least common multiple of 5 and 12... 
  
  Then find the greatest common factor between that number and 12."
  
  
What is your answer?
