You have finally reached the door to the midterm boss.
Over the door you read the following inscription:

"To enter this room, enter a number larger than 100,
then enter a factor of that number that is larger than 2. 
Only then will you be prepared for your final test."

You find two keypads on the door for entering the numbers...
