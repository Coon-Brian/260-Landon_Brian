A secret passage way has opened. You follow it down a winding set of steps
leading into a strange room. The walls are covered in trapezoid holes of
various sizes. As you enter the wall shuts behind you, leaving you trapped.

On the far wall you see a trapezoid shaped door. The door has two
rotating knobs, allowing you to magically change the size of the door.
To pass this puzzle, you must enter two integer values to change the 
size of the door. The area of the trapezoid must be larger than 10 feet^2, yet
smaller than 25 feet^2.
