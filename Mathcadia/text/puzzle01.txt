A secret passage way has opened. You follow it down a winding set of steps
leading into a strange room. The walls are covered in trapezoid holes of
various sizes. As you enter the wall shuts behind you, leaving you trapped.

On the far wall you see a trapezoid shaped door. The door has two
rotating knobs, allowing you to magically change the height and bottom
length of the door. The top length is fixed at 3 feet.

To pass this puzzle, you must enter two integer values to change the 
size of the door. The area of the trapezoid must be larger than 10 feet^2, yet
smaller than 25 feet^2.
( Note: The formula for the area of a trapezoid is height * top Length * bottom Length / 2 )
