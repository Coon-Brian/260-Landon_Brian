After your last battle, you suddenly realize that you have forgotten one
very important thing. You have not stayed hydrated! After the many battles
that you have been through, on your way to battel the monster in the next
room, you are hit with a thirst that consumes your mind. You can’t continue
on to fight another monster unit you quench your dying thrust.

You see a then see a door that has a sign on it marked “Water”. You get very
excited as you think that this is going to be an easy way to satisfy you thrust.

As you walk in, the room is bare except to a lone cone paper cup locked in a
cage and a deep hole in the wall for the paper cone to fit to get water. There
is a sign that says “For water, you must figure out the diameter and the height
for the cup.  The volume must be more than 40, and it must be less than 65.9734
when completely full.” Only then will the cage open an release the cup.

Hint: you will use the formula for a cone V = 1/3 pi * r^2 * h.
Remember, radius = diameter / 2
