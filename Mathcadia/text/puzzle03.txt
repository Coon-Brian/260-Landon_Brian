After your last battle, you suddenly realize that you have forgotten one
very important thing. You have not stayed hydrated! After the many battles
that you have been through, on your way to battle the monster in the next
room, you are hit with a thirst that consumes your mind. You can’t continue
on to fight another monster until you quench your dying thirst.

You then see a door that has a sign on it marked “Water”. You get very
excited as you think that this is going to be an easy way to satisfy your thirst.

As you walk in, the room is bare except for a lone cone paper cup locked in a
cage and a deep hole in the wall for the cone paper cup to fit in to get water. There
is a sign that says:

“For water, you must figure out the diameter and the heightfor the cup.  The volume
must be more than 40, and it must be less than 65.9734 when completely full.” 

Only then will the cage open and release the cup.

Hint: you will use the formula for a cone V = 1/3 pi * r^2 * h.
Remember, radius = diameter / 2
